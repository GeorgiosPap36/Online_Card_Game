WutStone is an online card game inspired by the popular mechanics of Hearthstone. The game was developed using Unity and uses the "Photon Engine" asset for online functionality. I handled the programming, while my friends designed the cards and game mechanics.
Features:
1. Online Multiplayer: Play against other players in real-time with full online support.
2. Lobby System: Create or join game lobbies easily to start matches with friends or other players.
3. Spectator Mode: Watch ongoing games and learn strategies by observing other players.
4. Manual Gameplay: The design is not fully finished, so gameplay actions need to be manually controlled.

### Notes
1. The gameâ€™s design phase was never finished, meaning some elements like automated gameplay are not yet implemented. However, it provides a robust foundation for multiplayer card game fans to enjoy and build upon.
2. Due to the use of copyrighted placeholder art, I am unable to upload a build of the project to this repository.
